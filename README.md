# Advent of Code 2023
This December I partook in Advent of Code. AoC is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and levels. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other. They can be solved in any programming language, I chose Python.

### Here are my Solutions:
Linked below are abstracted versions of the problem I was set (you can click on the Part One/Two sub headings on each page if you wish to see the original puzzle) along with the solution I came up with.
