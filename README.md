# Advent of Code 2023

This year, I participated in Advent of Code, an annual programming challenge comprising of 25 progressively challenging two-part puzzles released daily throughout December. 
The event encourages problem-solving and creativity, attracting a diverse community of participants worldwide. You solve puzzles using your preferred programming language, I chose Python.

### Here are my Solutions:

Linked below are abstracted versions of the problem I was set (you can click on the Part One/Two sub headings on each page if you wish to see the original puzzle) along with the solution I came up with.
